Together with [Martina Cinquini](https://marti5ini.github.io/) and [Riccardo Massidda](https://pages.di.unipi.it/massidda/) we are the proud founders of the Causal Club, a reading group on causality hosted at the University of Pisa.

The Causal Club is a friendly environment (hosted partly in Pisa, partly online) where people working on the broad topic of causality can share and discuss their latest works/research directions.
The goal is to provide a space where feedback can be shared and, hopefully, new collaborations can be born after a useful discussion.
Since this is a (very) informal space, all the preliminary ideas are more than welcome!
