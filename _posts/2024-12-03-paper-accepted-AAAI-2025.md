The work ["Things Machine Learning Models know that they don't know"](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35094) with Salvatore Ruggieri has been accepted at the Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2025.

This paper collects our past experiences in the field of abstaining/deferring systems and provides a general overview of existing methods that aim to tackle the difficult task of building ML models that are self-aware of their own limits. 
Moreover, we envision a few research directions for future investigations in this field.

A final thanks to Salvatore Ruggieri for his support throughout this work and these past few years.
