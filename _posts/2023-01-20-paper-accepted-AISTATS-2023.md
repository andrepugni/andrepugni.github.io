The work [AUC-based Selective Classification](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/pugnana23a.html) has been accepted at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2023.


A huge thanks to my PhD supervisor Salvatore Ruggieri for his help.
The work proposes a new selective classification method based on the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric. The method is model-agnostic and can be used with any classifier.


See you in Valencia for the conference!
