The work [Topics in Selective Classification](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26925) has been accepted at the Doctoral Consortium of AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2023.
A huge thanks to my PhD supervisor Salvatore Ruggieri for his help.

The work summarizes my achievements so far in my PhD project and its future directions.

See you in Washington DC for the conference!
