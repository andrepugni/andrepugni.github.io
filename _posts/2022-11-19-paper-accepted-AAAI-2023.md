The work "A Model-agnostic Heuristics for Selective Classification" has been accepted at the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2023.
A huge thanks to my PhD supervisor Salvatore Ruggieri for his help.

The work proposes a simple-yet-effective model-agnostic heuristics for selective classification.

See you in Washington DC for the conference!
