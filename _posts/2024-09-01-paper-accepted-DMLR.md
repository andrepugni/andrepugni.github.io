The work ["Deep Neural Network Benchmarks for Selective Classification"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xDPzHbtAEs) has been accepted for pubblication in The Journal of Data-Centric Machine-Learning Research (DMLR).

This work provides the first benchmark for selective classification with deep neural networks. 
We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the most popular deep learning architectures according to different criteria.
The code can be found [here](https://github.com/andrepugni/ESC).

A final thanks to my coauthors Lorenzo Perini, Jesse Davis and Salvatore Ruggieri for their help.
