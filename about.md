Hello there, this is Andrea! I am from Sarzana, Italy, and I am currently a research fellow at University of Trento focusing on teaching ML models to learn what they do not know.

I obtained a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University (Milan, Italy) in 2018 and
a PhD in Data Science from Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa, Italy) in 2024.

During my PhD, I worked under the supervision of professor [Salvatore Ruggieri](https://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/) 
and [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://www.santannapisa.it/it/francesca-chiaromonte).

My thesis focused on Selective Prediction, a framework that extends supervised learning by allowing ML models
to abstain from making predictions on examples that are too hard to predict. 
This is a crucial feature for real-world applications, where the cost of making a mistake can be high.

My research interests currently include abstaining systems, deferring systems, causal inference and fair AI.

Please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=BlN-HBoAAAAJ&hl=it) for an updated list of my publications, and my [GitHub](https://github.com/andrepugni) for updated repositories.

When I am not working, I enjoy doing a bunch of things, including living surrounded by a wood with my partner Caroline,
bothering my family with random arguments, failing at bouldering, acting for [Compagnia Ordinesparso](https://www.instagram.com/compagnia_ordinesparso/?hl=en), anything related to football and fantacalcio (fantasy football).
